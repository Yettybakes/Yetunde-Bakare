Objective: Develop a predictive model based to forecast customer churn for an electricity power 
company, focusing on the SME customer segment.
Background: The company has experienced a significant churn rate in the SME segment, 
impacting revenue. Research indicates that price sensitivity is a major factor driving churn. The 
project’s goal is to predict customers likely to churn and devise strategies to reduce this rate.
Data Provided:
• Customer Data: Includes client characteristics such as industry, historical electricity 
consumption, and date joined.
• Churn Data: Indicates whether a customer has churned.
• Historical Price Data: Shows the prices charged to each customer for electricity and gas 
at various intervals.
Tasks:
1. Data Exploration: Analyse the datasets to understand the factors contributing to 
customer churn.
2. Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features that could improve the 
model’s predictive power.
3. Model Development: Use the appropriate algorithm(s) to develop the churn prediction 
model.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Strategy Formulation: Based on the model’s insights, propose targeted strategies to 
reduce churn, focusing on high-value customers with a high probability of churning.
